The Biomass Harvest extension uses the same libraries as the Base Harvest extension but also supports the partial thinning of cohorts. The Biomass Harvest Extension is only compatible with succession extensions that are compatible with the biomass library, allowing translation to species, age, and aboveground biomass data.

Changes to this extension are governed by the [**Repository Rules**](https://sites.google.com/site/landismodel/developers) from the Technical Advisory Committee.

Eric Gustafson is the custodian of this extension.
